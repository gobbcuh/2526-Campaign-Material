          My love for organization and paperwork started early on, and thatâ€™s what led me to the <strong>Office of the Secretary</strong>. While it may seem like we are just handling documents, this role is more than that. It requires <strong>clear communication, attention to detail, and reliability</strong>.
        </p>
        <p class="section-text">
          Being in this office has been helpful to improve my ability to <strong>manage and help my executives</strong>. We also get to lead initiatives that create meaningful opportunities for my co-students.
